# Components Overview

Components are the visual elements placed inside dashboard panels. There are three categories:

## Charts

Data visualization components that render using ECharts. They query a data connection and display results as interactive charts.

Types: Bar, Line, Area, Pie, Scatter, Gauge, Data Table, Number, Custom

See [Chart Types](chart-types.md) for details.

## Controls

Interactive UI elements that send commands to devices via MQTT or WebSocket connections. Controls can read device state and send commands.

Types: Button, Toggle, Slider, Text Input, Plug, Dimmer, Tile Plug, Tile Dimmer, Text Label

See [Control Types](control-types.md) for details.

## Displays

Specialized visual components for specific integrations that don't use the standard chart rendering.

Types: Frigate Camera, Weather

See [Display Types](display-types.md) for details.

## Component Library

All components are stored in a shared library. The same component can be used across multiple dashboards and panels. When you edit a component, the changes appear everywhere it's used.

Access the full component library from Design Mode > Components.
